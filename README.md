# 🍯 Honey Purity Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the **purity of honey** based on various chemical and physical parameters. Adulteration in honey is a growing concern, and this project aims to help identify pure versus impure samples using data-driven techniques.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Goal**: To predict whether honey is pure or adulterated using machine learning.
- **Data**: The dataset includes different features related to honey composition.
- **Notebook**: [`purity honey -checkpoint.ipynb`](./purity%20honey%20-checkpoint.ipynb)

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for model building)

## 🧪 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and formatting
   - Handling missing values
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing feature distributions
   - Understanding relationships
3. **Model Training**
   - Using ML models like Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, etc.

## 📊 Sample Output

- Model Accuracy: _~xx%_ (replace with your result)
- Visualizations showing feature importance or class separation
